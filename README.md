# Webshop Data Analysis – SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my SQL skills by analyzing a fictional webshop database I created using Python. The goal is to extract actionable business insights from sales and customer data using PostgreSQL.

### Database Schema
The database consists of four tables:
- **Customers**: Customer details (e.g., Name, Age, Country)
- **Orders**: Purchase records (e.g., Order_ID, Order_Date)
- **OrderDetails**: Order line items (e.g., Quantity, Product_ID)
- **Products**: Product catalog (e.g., Product_name, Price)

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
- Multi-table operations (`INNER JOIN`)
- Filtering and grouping (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`)
- Subqueries and nested queries
- Date manipulation (`DATE_TRUNC`)

## Project Structure
The queries are stored in `webshop_analysis.sql` and organized into two main sections:

### Base Reports
- **Total Revenue**: Calculates the webshop's total sales revenue.
- **Top 5 Best-Selling Products**: Identifies the most popular products by quantity sold.
- **Monthly Revenue Analysis**: Tracks revenue trends over time.

### Customer Analysis
- **Top 5 Highest-Spending Customers**: Highlights customers with the highest total spending.
- **High-Value Customer Segmentation**: Analyzes spending patterns and order frequency for valuable customers.
- **Customer Demographics & High-Spending Countries**: Examines age distribution in high-revenue markets.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Database Creation**: I generated the fictional webshop database using `project_preparing.py` (Python script included). Alternatively, you can manually set up the schema in PostgreSQL.
2. **Run the Queries**:
   - Open a PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, psql).
   - Load the database schema (if not using the Python script).
   - Execute `webshop_analysis.sql` to run the queries.

## Key Insights
### Revenue & Sales Performance
- Total revenue generated by the webshop (e.g., $50,000 – sample output).
- Monthly revenue trends showing seasonal peaks (e.g., highest in December).
- Top-selling product: "Product A" with 500 units sold.

### Customer Behavior & Segmentation
- Top spender: "Jane Doe" with $7,500 in purchases.
- High-value customers spend ≥$5,000 and average ≥$1,000 per order.
- Average customer age in high-revenue countries (e.g., 35 in Germany).

## Why This Project?
This project showcases my ability to:
- Design and query a relational database.
- Write complex SQL to solve real-world business problems.
- Generate insights that drive decision-making.

## Next Steps
- Visualize results using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) or Power BI.
- Expand the dataset with additional metrics (e.g., product categories).

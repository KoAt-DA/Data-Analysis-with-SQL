# Webshop Data Analysis – SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This project showcases my SQL skills by analyzing a fictional webshop database.

The database includes four tables:

- Customers – Customer details
- Orders – Purchase records
- OrderDetails – Order line items
- Products – Product catalog

Using PostgreSQL, I executed various SQL queries to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and business insights.

## SQL Skills Demonstrated

This project covers essential SQL techniques:

- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- JOIN operations (INNER JOIN)
- Filtering & Grouping (GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY)
- Subqueries and Nested Queries
- Date functions (DATE_TRUNC)

## The Project.sql file Structure

- Base Reports

  - Total Revenue – Calculates total sales revenue
  - Top 5 Best-Selling Products – Identifies the most popular products
  - Monthly Revenue Analysis – Shows revenue trends over time

- Customer Analysis
  - Top 5 Highest-Spending Customers – Identifies high-value customers
  - High-Value Customer Segmentation – Analyzes spending patterns & order frequency
  - Customer Demographics & High-Spending Countries – Examines age distribution in key markets

## Setup and Usage

- Firts of all i created a fictional webshop database with project_preparing.py.However, you can set up the database in pgAdmin or any other SQL client manually.

- Run the queries in PostgreSQL:
  - Open pgAdmin or any SQL client
  - Execute the SQL files

## Key Insights from the Analysis

- Revenue & Sales Performance:

  - The total revenue generated by the webshop
  - Monthly revenue trends & seasonal patterns

- Customer Behavior & Segmentation:
  - Who are the top spending customers?
  - What is the average customer age in high-revenue countries?
  - How do purchase patterns vary across customers?
